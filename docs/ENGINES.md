## 1. Planner — `planner.ts`

### `generateWeekPlan(req, recipes, opts?)`

Fills 7 days × (breakfast, lunch, dinner) from `req.weekStart` (a Monday), greedily,
slot by slot in calendar order.

**Hard filters** (`filters.ts` — a recipe failing any of these is never offered):

- **Diet** — `recipe.diets` must intersect the accepted set for `profile.diet`.
  Vegan ⊂ vegetarian ⊂ eggetarian/pescatarian ⊂ non-vegetarian, so a vegan recipe is fine
  for a vegetarian but not the reverse.
- **Allergies** — free-text labels are expanded to ingredient tokens
  (`eggs → egg`, `dairy → milk/curd/paneer/ghee/butter/cheese/…`, `nuts → peanut/cashew/almond/…`,
  `gluten → wheat/maida/bread/pasta/semolina/rava/…`, `shellfish → prawn/shrimp/crab/…`,
  `soy → soya/tofu/soybean`) and matched **word-wise** against ingredient ids and names, so
  `egg` matches "Eggs" but not "eggplant". An unrecognised label is used as a token verbatim.
- **Disliked ingredients** — same token matcher over `profile.dislikedIngredients`.
- **Equipment** — `recipe.equipment ⊆ profile.equipment`, except that `stove`, `frying_pan`,
  `kadai` and `tawa` are treated as one interchangeable basic hob-and-pan setup.
- **Slot** — `recipe.mealTypes` must include the slot's meal type. (If that leaves no
  candidate at all the slot requirement is relaxed rather than leaving a hole in the week.)

**Soft score** — five components, each normalised to 0–100, combined with weights taken from
the *order* of `profile.priorities`: 1st = 0.35, then 0.25, 0.2, 0.12, 0.08 (weights sum to 1;
unranked priorities are back-filled in the default order).

| Component | Formula |
|---|---|
| **nutrition** | `0.55·kcalScore + 0.45·proteinScore + goalBonus`, where the slot target is `dailyCalorieTarget × split` (breakfast 0.25 / lunch 0.40 / dinner 0.35), `kcalScore = 100·exp(−½((kcal−target)/(0.35·target))²)` and `proteinScore = 100·min(1, protein/proteinTarget)`. Goal bonus: `muscle_gain` +15 `high_protein`; `weight_loss` +10 `low_cal` +5 `high_fiber`; `improve_energy` +10 for oats/banana/ragi/millet/rice-type ingredients +4 `high_fiber`; otherwise +5 `high_fiber` / +5 `high_protein`. |
| **time** | Limit = 20 / 35 / ∞ min for `low` / `medium` / `high`; `varies` → 30 min Mon–Fri, ∞ at weekends. Inside the limit `100 − 40·(total/limit)` (60–100); over it `60 − 2.5·(total − limit)`, floored at 0. |
| **budget** | Weekly allowance `budgetMonthly / 4.3`. Per-meal allowance = remaining budget ÷ remaining slots. Cost = `costPerServing × servings`. At or under allowance `100 − 25·(cost/allowance)` (75–100); over it decays linearly to 0; a meal that would push the running total past the weekly budget scores **0**. |
| **waste_reduction** | Grams of pantry stock expiring within 4 days that the recipe uses *and* that the meal is scheduled **on or before** the expiry date. `100·min(1, covered/250 g)`, multiplied by `0.75 + 0.35·urgency` where `urgency = 1/(1 + days left)`. Claimed grams are deducted so later days do not re-claim the same stock. |
| **taste** | Base 40, +18 cuisine ∈ `profile.cuisines`, +18·max(0, 1 − |spiceΔ|/2.5) where the target is `spiceLevel + 2·spiceAdjust`, +12 fuzzy `favoriteFoods` match on the recipe name, +20·recipeScore, +8·cuisineAffinity, +8·mean tagAffinity, +8·mean ingredientAffinity (all `PreferenceModel` terms clamped to −1..1). |

**Variety penalty** (subtracted from the weighted total): the same recipe within 3 days costs
`40 − 10·gap` points; each earlier meal that day sharing the `primaryMethod` costs 10 and each
sharing the `cuisine` costs 6.

**Determinism** — up to 6 points of jitter from a `mulberry32` PRNG seeded with
`hash(weekStart | userId | seed)`. Same inputs → identical plan; pass `opts.seed` ("Regenerate")
for a different but equally reproducible one. `opts.ingredients` supplies the catalog so `pcs`
pantry quantities convert to grams; `opts.today` overrides the reference date for "expiring soon".

**Servings** = `servingsDefault × (preferences?.portionAdjust ?? 1)`, rounded to the nearest 0.5,
minimum 1. `generatedBy` is always `"heuristic"`. Locked meals from `req.lockedMeals` that fall
inside the week are kept verbatim (only `planId` is re-pointed at the new plan) and their slots
are not re-filled.

### `adaptPlan(plan, change, ctx)`

Only meals **on or after `change.date`**, not `locked`, and still `planned` may change. The
change applies to `change.mealType` when given, otherwise to the whole day (`skip_meal` and
`eating_out` default to dinner).

| `ScheduleChangeType` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `skip_meal` | Removes the meal from the plan. |
| `eating_out` | Sets `status: "eating_out"`. If `goal === "weight_loss"`, the day's other editable meals are re-picked under a kcal cap of `slotTarget × 0.8`, biased toward `low_cal` / `high_fiber`. |
| `guests` | `servings × (1 + guestCount / servingsDefault)`, rounded to 0.5, and swaps to a `guest_friendly` recipe when one exists. |
| `less_time` | Re-picks any meal whose `prepTimeMin + cookTimeMin` exceeds `availableMinutes`, preferring recipes that fit and biasing the `quick` tag. |
| `mood_change` | Biases tags and applies the mood's predicate: `light → low_cal/high_fiber`, `comfort → comfort/one_pot`, `spicy → spiceLevel ≥ 3`, `no_cooking → prep+cook ≤ 10 min or raw`, plus `mild`, `quick`, `healthy`, `protein`, `budget`. |

### `diffPlans(before, after)`

Matches meals by id, falling back to `date|mealType`, and reports only real changes:
`{ mealId, date, mealType, fromRecipeId?, toRecipeId?, fromServings?, toServings?, statusChange? }`,
plus removals (only `from…`) and additions (only `to…`), sorted by date then slot.

### Explainability

`scoreRecipe(recipe, slot, ctx)` returns `{ total, parts }` with every component plus
`expiringItems` / `expiringGrams`; `explainMeal(recipe, slot, ctx)` renders the top three as one
line — *"Uses 2 items expiring soon · high protein · 20 min"*.

---

## 2. Grocery — `grocery.ts`

`buildGroceryList(plan, recipes, pantry, ingredients)`

1. For each meal still `planned`, add `ingredient.grams × (meal.servings / recipe.servings)` to
   that ingredient's requirement list, tagged with the meal date.
2. Convert pantry rows to grams (`pcs × gramsPerPiece`, fallback 50 g; `ml ≈ g`) into lots
   carrying their expiry.
3. `shortfall()` walks the requirements in date order and consumes lots **FIFO by expiry**,
   skipping any lot that expires *before* the meal date — food that goes off on Tuesday cannot
   feed Thursday's dinner.
4. Round the uncovered grams up to a pack size: spices/salt 50 g, oils 200 ml, grains / flours /
   dals / legumes 500 g, vegetables 100 g, proteins 250 g, dairy 500 g-ml, fruits & nuts 100 g,
   other 100 g. `pcs` items round up to whole pieces.
5. `estimatedCost = grams / 1000 × costPerKg`; `unit` comes from the catalog. Lines with
   need ≤ 0 are skipped. Items are sorted by name.

`groceryTotals(list)` → `{ itemCount, purchasedCount, totalGrams, estimatedCost, purchasedCost, remainingCost }`.

---

## 3. Nutrient retention — `retention.ts` + `retention-factors.ts`

Two layers.

**Layer 1 — method.** `BASE_RETENTION[method][nutrient]` approximates the
**USDA Table of Nutrient Retention Factors, Release 6 (2007)**: the share of a nutrient that
survives a cooking method before any allowance for time or temperature. Examples —
boil: vitC 0.55, folate 0.60, B6 0.70, A 0.90, protein 0.95, fat 0.95, iron 0.85, calcium 0.90,
fiber 1.00; steam: vitC 0.80, folate 0.85, B6 0.85; sauté: vitC 0.70, folate 0.75, B6 0.85,
A 0.85, fat 0.90; stir-fry vitC 0.75; deep-fry vitC 0.60, fat 0.85 (stands in for oil uptake),
protein 0.90; pressure cook vitC 0.60, folate 0.70; microwave vitC 0.85; simmer vitC 0.65;
bake/roast/grill vitC 0.65, folate 0.70, protein 0.92 (charring); raw 1.00.

**Layer 2 — kinetics.** Per heat step, first-order thermal degradation:

```
R *= exp(−k(T) · Δt_min)          k(T) = k_ref · Q10^((T − 100) / 10)
```

`k_ref` (per minute at 100 °C): vitamin C 0.010, folate 0.007, B6 0.004, vitamin A 0.003;
protein, fat, iron, calcium and fiber are 0, so they move only with the base factor.
`Q10` = 2.0 for the water-soluble vitamins (van 't Hoff), 1.5 for vitamin A.

- **Temperature** per step: `stepLog.avgTempC` → mean of `temperatureHistory` inside the step's
  window (the window is derived from `stepLog.startedAt/endedAt` relative to the earliest step
  log) → midpoint of `step.targetTempC` → the method default (boil 100, sauté 150, stir-fry 180,
  deep-fry 180, bake 180, roast 200, grill 220, pressure cook 115, microwave 100, raw 25 °C).
- **Duration** per step: `stepLog.durationSec` → `endedAt − startedAt` → `step.durationSec`.
- **Exposure**: `step.addIngredients` determines when each ingredient enters the pan; an
  ingredient only takes the base factor of the first heat step it is present for, and only the
  kinetics of the steps at or after it. Ingredients not named in any step are present from the
  start. A recipe with no steps is treated as one step of `recipe.primaryMethod` lasting
  `cookTimeMin`.

**Aggregation.** Each nutrient is weighted by how much of it the dish actually contains —
`ingredientLogs.actualGrams` where the scale measured it, otherwise recipe grams scaled to the
cooked servings — so the reported figure is content-weighted, not a plain average.
A nutrient whose per-serving content is below **2 % of a typical daily value**
(vitC 90 mg, B6 1.7 mg, folate 400 µg, A 900 µg, protein 50 g, fat 70 g, iron 18 mg,
calcium 1000 mg, fiber 28 g) is omitted entirely.

**Overall** = weighted mean with vitC 0.25, folate 0.15, B6 0.15, A 0.10, protein 0.20, fat 0.05,
iron 0.05, calcium 0.025, fiber 0.025, **renormalised over the nutrients actually shown**.

**Notes** (mockup tone): ≥ 0.90 "Well preserved." · ≥ 0.75 "Good retention!" ·
≥ 0.60 and every step inside its target range "Optimal temperature." ·
otherwise "Some loss due to heat. Consider shorter cooking time."

**Warnings**: a nutrient below 60 % → `warn`, below 40 % → `critical`; a pan-fry step whose
`maxTempC` exceeds 180 °C; anything past 200 °C (charring, an `info` warning on protein);
a step that ran longer than 1.5× its planned duration.
**Tips** are 2–3 strings, always led by
*"Cooking at medium heat helps retain more vitamins. Avoid overcooking."*

> Worked example — 200 g spinach, boiled 10 min at 100 °C:
> `0.55 · exp(−0.010 × 10) = 0.4977` → **50 % vitamin C**.

### Live coaching

`liveRetentionHint(step, currentTempC, elapsedSec)` → `{ tone, message }`:

- `ok` inside `targetTempC` — *"Keep temperature between 120°C – 150°C for better nutrient retention."*
- `warn` above `max` (by ≤ 20 °C) or past 1.25× the planned duration
- `danger` above `max + 20 °C` (*"Too hot — lower the flame to protect vitamin C."*) or past
  1.6× the duration (*"Onions has cooked 2 min longer than planned; move on to the next step."*)

### Actual cooked nutrition

`computeNutritionFromLogs(recipe, ingredients, logs, servings)` → `NutritionPerServing`, using
measured grams where the dock logged them. The home and feedback screens use it for daily intake.

## 4. Learning — `learning.ts`

Every rating nudges the model with an exponential moving average, **α = 0.3**:
`new = old + α·(target − old)`, clamped to −1..1.

- `recipeScores[recipe.id]` moves toward `(rating − 3) / 2`.
- `ingredientAffinity`, `cuisineAffinity`, `tagAffinity` move toward a blend
  `0.6·rating + 0.4·taste` (also mapped through `(x − 3)/2`), because taste is the better signal
  for *what* was in the dish.
- `spiceAdjust`: `too_hot` −0.2, `too_mild` +0.2, `just_right` decays ×0.9 back toward the
  profile; clamped −1..1. `spiceTargetFor(profile, model) = round(spiceLevel + 2·spiceAdjust)`
  clamped to 1..5.
- `portionAdjust`: `too_little` ×1.1, `too_much` ×0.9; clamped 0.6..1.6.

All updates are immutable — new record objects, `feedbackCount + 1`, fresh `updatedAt`.

`recommend(recipes, model, profile, n)` applies the same hard filters as the planner, then sorts by

```
0.5·recipeScore + 0.2·mean(ingredientAffinity) + 0.15·cuisineAffinity + 0.15·mean(tagAffinity)
```

with ties broken on recipe name so the order is stable between renders.

---

## 5. Sensor dock — `sensor.ts`

`createSensorDock(kind)` returns `SimulatedSensorDock` (default) or `WebBluetoothDock`.
Nothing reads `window` / `navigator` at module scope, so the module is safe to import from a
server component.

### `SimulatedSensorDock`

Emits a `SensorReading` every **200 ms** while connected.

- **Weight** eases toward `target`: each tick closes **35 %** of the gap, and the *reported*
  value carries ±0.3 g of noise (the internal value stays clean). `stable` flips true once
  `|target − weight| < 0.5 g` for **4 consecutive ticks**. `tare()` stores the current smoothed
  weight as an offset so the pan reads 0 g; `simulateAdd(g)` raises (or lowers) the target and
  clears the stable flag.
- **Temperature** approaches the burner setpoint first-order with a time constant of **8 s**:
  `T += (setpoint − T)·(Δt/8)`. Setpoints by level are `[25, 90, 120, 150, 200] °C`; level 0 is
  off and cools back to the 25 °C ambient. `getBurner()` reports the current level.
- The noise generator is seedable (`new SimulatedSensorDock({ seed })`) so tests are reproducible;
  `read()` returns the latest value without waiting for a tick.

### `WebBluetoothDock`

`connect()` rejects with
`"Web Bluetooth is not available on this device. Using the simulator instead."`
when `navigator.bluetooth` is missing. Otherwise it requests a device filtered on the Bluetooth
SIG **Weight Scale** service `0x181D`, subscribes to the **Weight Measurement** characteristic
`0x2A9D` and parses notifications with this **assumed protocol** (little-endian, 6–7 bytes):

| Bytes | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 | `int32` | weight in grams |
| 4–5 | `int16` | pan temperature × 10 °C |
| 6 | `uint8` | flags — bit 0 = weight stable (optional) |

A 4-byte payload is read as weight-only and assumed stable. The reference dock has no tare
command, so `tare()` zeroes in software against the last raw reading. `parseDockPayload(view)` is
exported so the protocol can be unit-tested without hardware.

---

## 6. Tests

`npm test` (→ `vitest run`, config at `vitest.config.ts`, `@/` aliased to `./src`).
Engine specs live in `src/lib/engines/__tests__/` and use their own fixtures
(`fixtures.ts`) rather than `src/lib/data/seed/*`, so they stay stable while the catalog grows.

## Food-temperature correction (added during integration)

The kinetics use the temperature of the **food**, not the pan. Water-rich food stays near 100 °C until it dries out, so `effectiveFoodTempC(pan) = min(140, 100 + 0.25·(pan − 100))` for pan temperatures above 100 °C (unchanged below). Without it a 190 °C stir-fry would pin every heat-labile vitamin to the floor within a minute. The Python service applies the identical `effective_food_temp_c()`.
